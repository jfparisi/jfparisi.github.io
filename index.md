                 <p>Hello there. I am a theoretical physicist working on turbulence in fusion plasmas. Currently, I am a Culham Fusion Research Fellow at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Previously, I was at the University of Oxford where I obtained my PhD in theoretical physics.<p>
                 <p>Science is arguably the most consequential tool our society has discovered/invented. Nuclear fusion energy is one of its most awesome applications: convert light stuff into slightly heavier stuff, and gain some useful energy in the process. One day, a large part of our energy requirements could be satisfied by this technology. I am somewhat of an energy maximalist: the ability to reliably generate large quantities of inexpensive and minimally-polluting electricity and distribute it fairly to all people is a great driver of human progress. Nuclear fusion is likely helpful for this goal.<p>
                 <p>In the early 2020s, nuclear fusion energy research is at a particularly exciting stage --- after a period of relative calm, we have several important devices being built, which will demonstrate the scientific feasibility of magnetic confinement fusion. Two in particular to watch are ITER and SPARC. These two devices represent two different philosophies for how to build a first generation commerical reactor: massive and low magnetic field, or compact and high field. There are also a plethora of other startups and government projects doing very exciting work.</p>
