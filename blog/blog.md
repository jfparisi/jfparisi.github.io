# Blog

Here, I will write about physics that is piquing my curiosity at any moment in time. Most of the writing is plasma physics/ fusion physics-themed. The entries will be either publicly accessible ($), somewhat technical ($$), or specialist ($$$). Whenever I publish a new scientific paper, I will also release a video explanation of the main paper ideas.

## The SPARC machine ($$) October 2nd 2020

In recent years, but particularly in the past week, there has been some seismic activity in the fusion community. On September 30 2020, one of the fusion startups, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), released the physics basis for its fusion reactor, SPARC (Smallest Possible Advanced Reactor Concept). The seven peer-reviewed papers are Open Access on the Journal of Plasma Physics ![website](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics/collections/status-of-the-sparc-physics-basis).

## Why fusion? ($)
