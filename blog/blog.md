Here, I will write about physics that is piquing my curiosity at any moment in time. Most of the writing is plasma physics/ fusion physics-themed. The entries will be either publicly accessible ($), somewhat technical ($$), or specialist ($$$). These views are my own, and don't necessarily reflect those of my employer. Whenever I publish a new scientific paper, I will also release a video explanation of the main paper ideas.

## ($$) The SPARC machine, October 2nd 2020

Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with the SPARC team, nor have I done any research on the machine.

In recent years, but particularly in the past week, there has been some seismic activity in the fusion community. On September 30 2020, one of the fusion startups, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), released the physics basis for its fusion reactor, SPARC (Smallest Possible Advanced Reactor Concept). The seven peer-reviewed papers are Open Access on the Journal of Plasma Physics [website](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics/collections/status-of-the-sparc-physics-basis). In my opinion, SPARC and the way CFS has made most of its physics basis publicly available is a rather big deal for fusion, which I will proceed to explain.

To understand the ramifications of SPARC's announcement, let us take a step back and see where progress in fusion is currently at. Since the 1940s until the late 1990s, experimental progress in fusion was fast: the triple product (the product of energy confinement time, density, and temperature), a key measure of plasma performance, had been increasing exponentially (its doubling time was actually faster than Moore's law for semiconductors). If progress had continued in the same fashion, we would have had a plasma with significant net gain by 2005-2010. Yet, here we are, in 2020, with no plasma with a significantly higher triple product (i.e. an order of magnitude) than that of the Joint European Torus (JET) or Japan Torus 60 (JT-60) in the 1990s. A lot has been written about this gap, so I shall not go into too much detail here, but in brief, the fusion community focused on building a single machine, ITER, which from design to first plasma (2025) will have taken around 40 years. ITER will not have its DT plasmas until at least the early 2030s. I am not going to offer judgement as to whether this was the right call, but simply state that this is where we are. Thus, to set the stage, we have no exponential experimental improvement in plasma performance in 20 years, in contrast to the 1940s-1990s. The lack of visible progress is not because of physics constraints, but rather the lack of new machines. Of course, it must be said that a huge amount of progress has been made in other areas of experimental fusion research (fueling, heating schemes, diagnostics, current drive, disruption mitigation, etc), but not in the triple product.

Since the late 1990s, a plethora of 'fusion startups' have popped up. None of them have had the same impact as SPARC, even Tokamak Energy, which is notionally similar to SPARC. 

Arguably, in the meantime, strides have been made in computational and theoretical understanding of fusion physics, such that SPARC might not have been possible twenty years.
